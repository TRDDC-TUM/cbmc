The dead-line is December 5th. Although we should consider this date as fixed,
Daniels also said the presentation may be extended by few days (but definitely
within the week December 5-9).

We should focus only to Java apps (no C!) and we should only focus on web issues
(XSS and SQL injection) and nothing else. Moreover, the goal is to show real
errors, ideally no false positives. Definitelly nothing like Polyspace, or "the
other tool whose name is some number".

Daniel will provide us some Java packages to be evaluated for the presentation
(some Amazon's code). Our analysis must be fully automated: User simply uses
Maven to build his program (which possibly includes automati download and build
of dependent packages); Then he just runs our analyser on build binaries.

The demo will be LIVE in a sense, that the customer might want to see the
analysis running (he might be willing to wait for results). In any case
(i.e. even if he wants to see only outputs), then we have to provide HTML
output. This is important. Daniel said that they use always use outputs to HTML
(more precisely browser) and always.

They want to see in output from our analyser global statistics like histograms
and other forms of charts about what was analysed, how much time we spent where,
etc.

We will present the demo to Brian Cook (I hope I remembered the name correctly).
He is very skilled with program analysis (he worked on SLAM). He won't be
interested too much in shiny graphics output, but HTML is mandatory, and most
importantly, he is mainly interested in statistics, distributions of
anything/everything, graphs, etc.

Daniel said that no code clean up till the dead-line of that demo.
