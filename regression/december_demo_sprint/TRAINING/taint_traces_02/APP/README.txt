This is a training benchmarks. It won't be part of the evaluation. Also, this is not Maven
application (actually it uses Ant). But this fact does not affect it use as a training bemchmark.

Installation on Ubuntu

1. Open terminal in the root directory of the souce code (there should be a file "build.xml")
   and run there this command: ant

Resulting JAR file is automatically copied into directory ../BENCHMARK, which is a destination
already consistent with this evaluation. So, no other steps are necessary.
