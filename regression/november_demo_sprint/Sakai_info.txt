      Description:
      Had to write around 20 lines of Java to inject a taint source into
      the program. And similar for the taint sink source is an InputStream
      that emits tainted bytes. The sink is an implementation of a
      data-access-object that checks its String argument for taint. I also had
      to remove one instance of reflection (replaced with direct invocation).
      and one instance of propagating taint via the filesystem (replaced with
      in-memory propagation).
