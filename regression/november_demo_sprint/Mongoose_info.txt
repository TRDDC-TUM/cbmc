Mongoose
~~~~~~~~

Mongoose is more than an embedded webserver. It is a multi-protocol embedded
networking library with functions including TCP, HTTP client and server,
WebSocket client and server, MQTT client and broker and much more.
It has been designed for connecting devices and bringing them online.
On the market since 2004, used by vast number of open source and commercial
products - it even runs on the International Space station! Mongoose makes
embedded network programming fast, robust, and easy.
